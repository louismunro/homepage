I am an operations architect currently toiling in the belly of the IT industry for fun and profit.

Jack of all trades, master of none. I have been a bookseller, an outdoor adventure guide, a freelance photographer, and a system administrator.

I live in Montreal, Canada and I am currently working as a Network and Operations Architect at Inverse where I help develop, deploy and maintain PacketFence, an open source Network Access Control solution.

If you have any comments or questions, you can email me at public@louismunro.com
